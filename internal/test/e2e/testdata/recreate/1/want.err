Path '/spec/host' of 'route/foo' is immutable.
Changing its value would require to delete and re-create the whole resource, which Tailor prevents by default.

You may pick one of the following options to resolve this:

* pass --allow-recreate to give permission to recreate the resource
* use --preserve-immutable-fields to keep the cluster state for all immutable paths
* change the template to be in sync with the cluster state
* exclude the resource from comparison via --exclude route/foo
